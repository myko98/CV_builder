- gonna references this guys project
  https://github.com/derekdkim/cv-generator/blob/main/src/components/EducationInfo/index.js
- live link
- https://derekdkim.github.io/cv-generator/

i think for every component it will hvve its own object that has properties from the inputs

- once i get the layout down for generfal info, it should be the same for the other 2
- the button in app.js will change between input and p tags
- started doing that but isnt fully functional yet...
